- this project is related to git repo: [https://github.com/clarklindev/microservices-stephengrider-with-node-and-react.git](https://github.com/clarklindev/microservices-stephengrider-with-node-and-react.git )

- specifically `## section 12 - code sharing and re-use between services (52min)`
- this is the shared module / npm package to be used by other services

#### tsconfig.json
- `"declaration": true` -> Generate .d.ts files from TypeScript and JavaScript files in your project. 
- `"outdir": './build'`

#### package.json
- `"main": "index.js"` this specifies the file to look for in the output (we set as `build` in tsconfig) folder
- below commented out as we use 'rimraf' package
<!-- - we installed the `del-cli` npm module
- del command used in the script is not valid for your operating system 
  - FIX: we install `cross-env` so `del-cli`  -->
- install `rimraf` as dev-dependency -> it can delete the directory itself without error if it doesn't exist
```json
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rimraf ./build",
  "build": "pnpm run clean && tsc"
}
```
#### TROUBLESHOOT
- index.ts entry file...
- By default, TypeScript (tsc) assumes the entry file is the root of your TypeScript files as specified in the tsconfig.json file or the tsc command. If no specific entry file is provided, it looks for .ts files based on configuration and conventions.

Hereâ€™s how TypeScript determines the entry file:

1. files, include, or exclude in tsconfig.json
If the tsconfig.json specifies include or files, TypeScript compiles only those files explicitly listed or matched by patterns.
Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "include": ["src/**/*"]
}
This will include src/index.ts, not index.ts.
2. Default Behavior Without Configuration
If files, include, and exclude are not specified in tsconfig.json, TypeScript includes all .ts files in the project directory and its subdirectories except node_modules.

#### 'name'
- this is value they will use for importing when working with this module
- eg. `import {} from '@organization/common'`

#### 'main' 
- package.json `main` property ->  when we are importing this module, what are they importing? we want it to reference `./build/index.js`
- ie. when using this package, and you reference the module via an import: `import {} from '@organization/common'`, where does this import point to...

#### 'types' 
- types is the reference to the types file generated when calling tsc compile.

#### 'files'
- 'files' -> an array that specifies what we want npm to include in our package

```json
"main": "./build/index.js",
"types": "./build/index.d.ts",
"files": ["build/**/*"] 
```
#### .gitignore
- add .gitignore 
- ignore the 'build' folder and 'node_modules'

#### running cmd
```
pnpm run build
```

### steps to updating
1. update the common/ shared repo (add / commit)

2. update the version (after commit)
- always have to update the version number when we publish our package
- look at semmantic versioning
- MANUALLY update the 'version' property of our package: `package.json`
- AUTO-INCREMENT: `pnpm version patch`

3. npm run build

4. npm publish

#### pub script
- can add to package.json "pub" script 
- NOT FOR PRODUCTION -> AS ALL CHANGES ARE ADDED TO COMMIT AT ONCE, ITS TOO GENERIC, VERSIONING NOT SPECIFIC

```js
"scripts": {
  "clean": "rimraf ./build",
  "build": "pnpm run clean && tsc",

  //VERSION BUMP HAPPENING AFTER
  "pub": "git add . && git commit -m \"updates\" && pnpm version patch && pnpm run build && pnpm publish",
},
```

- pub script creates two commits:

#### First commit (manual):
- `git add . && git commit -m "updates"`
- This stages all changes and creates a commit with the message "updates".

#### Second commit (automatic):
- `pnpm version patch`
- This bumps the version in package.json, commits it with a message like v1.0.1 (the new version), and adds a Git tag.

#### Result
Commit 1: "updates" (manual commit).
Commit 2: vX.Y.Z (automatic version bump commit from pnpm).

#### using pub script
- make a change
- `pnpm run pub`
